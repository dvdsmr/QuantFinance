# Quantittaive Finance with C++
This repo contains a code basis for quantitative methods in finance, coded C++ and visualized using Python. 

The repository contains tools to simulate modern stochastic models for stock movements. The example plot below shows three paths of a Heston model, used to to model stock prices with a stochastic volatility process.

Canonical models for derivative pricing are included. The below plot shows the development of the price, Delta and Gamma of a european call option in the Black-Scholes-Mertin model as time to maturity increases.
